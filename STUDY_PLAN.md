## 🎯 Handling Different Question Types

### Technical Questions:
**Example**: "Explain Bubble Sort"
**Answer**: "Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps if in wrong order. Time complexity is O(n²), space is O(1). We use it for price sorting."

### Conceptual Questions:
**Example**: "What is REST API?"
**Answer**: "REST is an architectural style for web services. It uses HTTP methods like GET and POST, and returns JSON data. Our Flask backend provides REST APIs."

### Why Questions:
**Example**: "Why Flask over Django?"
**Answer**: "Flask is lightweight and gives more control. For our project size, Flask is perfect. Django would be overkill with unnecessary features."

### Implementation Questions:
**Example**: "Show me the code"
**Answer**: "Sure, let me open app.py. Here's our main route..." (Show and explain)

### Future Questions:
**Example**: "What would you improve?"
**Answer**: "We'd add payment integration, real-time chat, and mobile app. Also AI-based recommendations for better user experience."
